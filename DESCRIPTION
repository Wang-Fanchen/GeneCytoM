Description: A comprehensive R package for comparing multimodal (gene + image) models
    against gene-only models at both the gene and cytoband levels. The package identifies
    genes whose importance is enhanced in multimodal settings, maps them to chromosomal
    cytobands, and provides cytoband-level attribution analysis with rich visualizations.
    It supports optional P-value filtering and generates multiple sorting perspectives
    (by multimodal attribution, difference, and ratio) to highlight cytobands enriched
    for multimodal-advantaged genes.
